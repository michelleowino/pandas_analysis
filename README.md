# Summary of Analysis and Observed Trends in School Performance: 
 
I created and manipulated Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data. The data is of 15 schools with 39,170 students with a total budget of $24,649,428.00. The average math score of all the schools is 78.99% and the average reading score is 81.88%. The percentage of students who passed math is 74.98% and the percentage of students who passed reading is 85.81%. A score of 70% or above is considered passing. The overall percentage of students who passed both math and reading is 65.17%.

The highest-performing schools based on overall percentage passing both math and reading are all charter schools. The lowest-performing schools based on overall percentage passing reading and math are all district schools.

When looking at the average math and reading scores by grade level, we notice that they are in line with each other. There is a slight difference for some of the schools, but the difference is no more than 2% to 3%. This suggests that grade level does not affect a student’s performance.

When looking at the average and percentage scores based on district spending per student, we notice that as the spending amount decreases, the average score and percentage increases. This raises a lot of questions because one would assume that as spending increases, average score and percentage would also increase.

When looking at scores based on school sizes, we notice that schools with fewer students perform better in both math and reading. There is a significant difference in large schools’ percentage overall passing when compared to small and medium size schools. Percentage of students in large schools who passed both math and reading is at 58.29%, while percentage of students in small and medium schools who passed both math and reading is 89.88% and 90.62%, respectively.

Based on the analysis, I conclude that charter schools perform better when compared to district schools. Additionally, a student is likely to perform better when attending smaller sized schools.
